The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class:

```css
.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}

.my-element {
  outline: none; /* This line might unintentionally override :focus-visible */
}
```

The problem arises when a more general selector like `.my-element` has an `outline: none;` style applied. This unintentionally overrides the `outline` specified in the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class, preventing the focused element's outline from appearing even when focus-visible is supported.  The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class is intended for adding visual focus indicators only when the focus is truly noticeable to users and not programmatically triggered.
