The solution involves ensuring that the `:focus-visible` selector has higher specificity or that conflicting styles are removed:

```css
.my-element {
  /* Removing this line solves the problem */
  /* outline: none; */
}

.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

By removing `outline: none;` from the general `.my-element` selector, the `:focus-visible` styles are applied correctly.  Alternatively, you could be very specific on the selector (using a child selector) for focus to prevent conflicts.
